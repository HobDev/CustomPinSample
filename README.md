# CustomPinSample
The code in this sample is written to show custom pins with Xamarin.Forms.Maps on iOS and Android.
The app first gets the user location and than  calls Google Places Api to search throgh hospitals and schools.
The Google places api key is required to use this sample. This sample can be used to show custom pins with other data.

The project is far from perfect. Open pull request, report an issue or ask for a feature in order to make it more useful for the community.
